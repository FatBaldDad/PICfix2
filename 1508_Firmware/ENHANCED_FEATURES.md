# Enhanced PIC12F508 PICfix Firmware - Robustness Features

## Overview
This enhanced version of the PIC12F508 PICfix firmware incorporates sophisticated error detection and robustness features while maintaining full compatibility with the original Matrix Team design philosophy.

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Watchdog Timer Integration
- **Purpose**: Prevents system lockups and ensures reliable operation
- **Timeout**: 18ms nominal (configurable via WDTE bits)
- **Implementation**: Intelligent clearing based on system state
- **Benefits**: Automatic recovery from unexpected conditions

### 2. Multi-Stage Error Detection
The enhanced firmware implements a Matrix Team-style multi-stage error detection algorithm:

#### Stage 1: Initial Detection (ERROR_CHECK_INITIAL)
- Waits for /INT_1869 signal to go LOW
- Requires 10 consecutive LOW readings for stability
- Prevents false triggers from brief glitches

#### Stage 2: Confirmation Phase (ERROR_CHECK_CONFIRMING)
- Timed verification over 2-second period
- Allows signal recovery during confirmation
- Implements escape mechanism for transient conditions

#### Stage 3: Final Verification (ERROR_CHECK_VERIFIED)
- 5-sample verification with 4-of-5 voting
- Final safeguard against false positives
- Triggers reset only after multiple confirmations

### 3. Glitch Filtering
- **Method**: 2-of-3 voting system for signal reading
- **Purpose**: Eliminates electrical noise and EMI effects
- **Implementation**: Multiple samples with majority vote
- **Reliability**: Significantly reduces false triggers

### 4. Enhanced LED Indication
- **Startup**: Rapid flashing (Matrix Team style)
- **Monitoring**: Smooth breathing effect using software PWM
- **Error**: Solid LED indication
- **Implementation**: Uses watchdog counter for timing precision

## Hardware Compatibility

### Pin Configuration (Unchanged from Original)
```
PIC12F508 Pinout:
Pin 1 (VDD)  - +5V Power
Pin 2 (GP5)  - Not used
Pin 3 (GP4)  - Not used  
Pin 4 (GP3)  - /INT_1869 Monitor (Input with pullup)
Pin 5 (GP2)  - Not used
Pin 6 (GP1)  - NPN Base Drive (Reset Control)
Pin 7 (GP0)  - LED Output
Pin 8 (VSS)  - Ground
```

### Configuration Bits
```c
#pragma config OSC = IntRC      // Internal RC oscillator (4MHz)
#pragma config WDT = ON         // Watchdog Timer enabled (18ms)
#pragma config CP = OFF         // Code protection disabled
#pragma config MCLRE = OFF      // GP3/MCLR pin as digital input
```

## Matrix Team Compatibility

### Timing Compatibility
- **Startup Delay**: 2 seconds (identical to original)
- **Error Timeout**: 2 seconds base + enhanced verification
- **Flash Period**: 250ms during startup
- **Overall Response**: Compatible with PS2 system timing

### Behavioral Compatibility
- Power-on behavior identical to original
- LED indication follows Matrix Team patterns  
- Reset activation method unchanged
- Pin usage completely compatible

## Advanced Error Detection Algorithm

### State Machine Flow
```
IDLE → INITIAL → CONFIRMING → VERIFIED → TRIGGERED
  ↑       ↓         ↓           ↓
  └───────┴─────────┴───────────┘
      (Signal recovery paths)
```

### Timing Parameters
- **Initial Detection**: 10 samples @ ~1ms intervals
- **Confirmation Period**: 2000ms with continuous monitoring
- **Final Verification**: 5 samples @ 1ms intervals
- **Total Detection Time**: ~2.015 seconds minimum

### Error Recovery
The enhanced algorithm includes multiple recovery paths:
1. **Early Recovery**: During initial detection phase
2. **Mid Recovery**: During confirmation phase  
3. **Late Recovery**: Before final trigger (last chance)

## Memory Usage
- **Flash**: ~400 words (well within 512 word limit)
- **RAM**: ~15 bytes (well within 25 byte limit)
- **Optimized**: For PIC12F508 resource constraints

## Compilation Options

### XC8 Compiler (Recommended)
```batch
xc8.exe --chip=12F508 --mode=pro --runtime=default picfix_508.c picfix_core.c
```

### Alternative Compilers
- **HI-TECH PICC Lite**: Compatible with minor modifications
- **MPASM**: Assembly conversion available if needed
- **SDCC**: Possible with PIC14 backend

## Testing and Validation

### Recommended Tests
1. **Power-On Behavior**: Verify 2-second startup with LED flash
2. **Normal Operation**: Confirm breathing LED during monitoring
3. **Error Response**: Test with simulated /INT_1869 stuck LOW
4. **Recovery Testing**: Verify recovery from transient conditions
5. **Watchdog Function**: Test system recovery from induced lockups

### Test Points
- **TP1**: LED output (GP0) - Monitor indication patterns
- **TP2**: Reset control (GP1) - Verify trigger activation
- **TP3**: Signal input (GP3) - Monitor /INT_1869 signal
